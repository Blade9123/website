  <p class="paragraph2">Some of my interests include microlight aircraft such as the one pictured on the right of the page,which is a flexwing type. Plus I have a keen interest in everything space related like the starship from Elon Musks Spacex project, pictured at the bottom of the screen where he wants to colonise mars in the future.I also have an interest in sailing because my brother is a sailing instructor, so I occasionally go out with him.
